# Murina-Iguleder
Yet another Murrina flavor.

The compiz theme in the shots is NovumOS by roberTO21. It seemed to beg for a very dark murina theme so here we are.
The background image is an old favorite of mine by creolabs.
Finally, the gtkrc spawned from MurinaBlackblue (by MeisterQ).
Thanks to all involved.
